Ehlo, my name is Juho and people tend to know me as whois online (or mr. salt guy). I am 31-year-old techie guy who likes digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).

I am currently GREM, OSCP, CISSP, GCFA and GMON certified and work as a Lead Incident Response Investigator for [Accenture Security](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/security/cyber-defense). I also host [Turvakäräjät-podcast](https://turvakarajat.fi), run Helsinki security meetup group [HelSec](http://www.helsec.fi) and teach forensics at [The National Defence Training Association of Finland](https://mpk.fi/etusivu/what-is-the-mpk/).
